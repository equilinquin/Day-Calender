# Day-Calender

This application is a simple day calendar to help mark appointments or events through out the current day.  On the top of the page, you will see the title and below it the current day.

If you want to add an event, click into the "Add Event" text area at the timeslot that you want.  Then click the save button on the right that is colored blue.  The event will then save and will remain on the page even when you refresh the page.

Gray represents time that has already passed.  Red represents the current hour of the day.  Green represents future times.  The text area will change color when the hour passes.

I used a lot of jQuery elements in javascript to shorthand a lot of assingments.  I also used the moment() function to generate the current time to align with the time slots.  The Day() function was also used to display current day.

The current time does not change the text area color when the page is live.  It changes when it refreshes.

Everything works according to the assignment guidelines that were followed into making this application.
